Name the three pillars of Science.  
Experiment, theory and physics.  
Name and briefly describe three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences.  
Weather forecasting Computational and Data Sciences are used in weather forecasting to collect 
and analyze huge amounts of atmospheric data from various sources.  
Name the two types of scientific reasoning.  
Inductive reasoning and Deductive reasoning.  
Provide an example that shows logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation.  
Logical implication-If it is raining, then the streets will be wet.  
Physical causation-The streets are wet because it rained.  
Policeman, jewelry, and burglar.  
A policeman finds jewerly in a suspects possesion and concludes they are a burglar but does not
prover they are guilty.  
Logical Implication.  
Refers to the relationship between two statements where the truth of one statement guarantees the truth 
of another statement.  
Logical product denial.  
Is a logical operation that negates the conjuction of two propositions known as not and.  
Logic functions with 1 input.  
Include the identity function which outputs the same value as its input.  
Logic functions with 2 input.  
Include AND, OR NOT OR and NOT AND.  
Logic functions in terms of logic functions.  
Can be expressed in terms of other logic functions through various combinations.  
The fundamental logical operators.  
Include AND, OR,NOT. these operators are used to manipulate logical values in propositional logic.  
Consider the following series of questions:

a. What is the tiniest unit of information?  
A Bit.  
Hint: This unit also represents the tiniest bit of information in computers.
b. Why does this amount of information represent the tiniest information unit?  
Anything smaller than a Bit can not hold meaningful data.  

Hint: Use inductive logic with examples to explain your reasoning.

Imagine yourself as a single dot in empty space in a universe devoid of anything else.
Would you be able to tell your coordinates in the universe?   
I would not be able to tell what my coordinates are.  
or whether you are moving? or at what constant speed?  
I would not be able to determine if im moving or what speed i am going.  

Why? What extra piece of information do you need to answer the above questions?  
I would need reference points to determine my coordinates.  

c. Letâ€™s assign a box to this tiniest representable amount of information.
Obviously, we cannot represent much information with it. So, our remedy is to put multiple of these boxes to represent information about something. 
1. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 1 such boxes?
2. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 2 such boxes?
3. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 3 such boxes?
Hint: Draw binary trees as we described in class to justify your answers.
