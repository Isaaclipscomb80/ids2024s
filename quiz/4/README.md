Name the four major definitions of Probability (corresponding to the four major schools of thought in probability theory).  
Classical definition of probability, Relative frequency definition of probability,
Subjective definition of probability and Axiomatic definition of probability.  

Which school(s) of probability theory define(s) probability as degree of confidence?  
The Bayesian school of probability theory.  

Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  
Bayesian probability theory.  

When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
the Bayesian school of probability theory.  

Name a prominent figure (person) in each of the Frequentist and Bayesian schools of thought.  
Ronald Fisher and Richard Cox.  

What is the range of a probability value? Is this range a convention or a necessity of the definition of probability?  
It is not possible to have a probability less than 0 or greater than 1.
this is a necessity.  

Recall our class discussion on Probability Theory. Suppose you ask two equally-trustworthy people 
to look out the window and tell you what they see in the distance. 
They both observe an animal in the distance but their observation is different. One sees a horse 
and the other sees donkey. 
Which one of the observations would you trust? 
Why? Which principle of Probability Theory applies to this experiment and how?  
i would trust the person who see's the horse because i feel like its more common to see a horse.
The Bayesian probability theory applies to this experiment because bayesian reasoning can weigh the evidence provided by each observer.  


NAND equivalence.

Logic NAND and NOR.

Logical implication in terms of logic functions.

Show via a Venn Diagram or a Truth Table, or explain by a logical argument that (A⇒B) ≡ (B⎯⎯⎯⎯⇒A⎯⎯⎯⎯).
