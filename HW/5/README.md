what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual attributes or design elements used to enhance the appeal, clarity, 
and effectiveness of the visualization.  

Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
Mapping and Positional  

Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics and is typically non-numeric.  
Quantitative data consists of numerical measurements or counts and is used to quantify and analyze phenomena.  

What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
Categorical variables.  

Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
High School Diploma, Bachelor's Degree, "Master's Degree, and Ph.D. represent an ordered sequence.  

What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
Quantitative  
Numerical/Categorical?
Discrete
Ordered  

What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
Horizontal axis and Vertical axis.  

Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations. 

Transforming the axes of the plot, such as using a logarithmic scale for highly skewed data, can
lead to better visualizations by improving the representation of trends, enhancing the interpretation 
of growth rates, and providing clearer insights into relationships within the data.  

Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?
All of them.  

What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
Spatial Data, Circular Data and cyclic Data.

Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
Sequential color scales are used for representing data that has a natural ordering or progression, 
such as numerical data ranging from low to high values.
Diverging color scales are effective for visualizing data with a meaningful midpoint or critical value, 
where values diverge in two directions from this midpoint.
Categorical color scales are used to represent distinct categories or groups within the data.
Heatmap color scales are commonly used for visualizing data in a tabular format, 
where colors represent the magnitude of values within each cell.  


What is wrong with the following visualization?  
It starts before 0.

Honolulu is hotter and their temperature flucuates less.

The proof of Bayesâ€™ Rule via Venn diagram.  

The major schools of thought in Probability Theory.  
Classical Probability, Frequentist Probability, Subjective Probability and Axiomatic Probability.
