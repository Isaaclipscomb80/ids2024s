What is the difference between model validation and calibration?  
Model validation typically involves splitting the available data into a training set and a separate validation set (or sets).

what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
Color zize and shape.  

Best visualization coloring.  
the top one.  
Visualization color scales.  
D
What is each color-scale good for in Data Science?  
equential color scales are effective for representing ordered or sequential data, where values vary from low to high or vice versa. 
They are suitable for visualizing data with a clear progression or trend.  

Name the three pillars of science.  
observation hypothesis and experiment.  

Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with a real-world example.

If it is raining outside, then the ground is wet.

Here, the logical implication states that if the condition "it is raining outside" is true, then the conclusion "the ground is wet" must also be true, based on our understanding of how rain causes wetness on the ground. This logical implication is based on the rules of logic and language.

 physical causation example:
"When it rains, the ground gets wet.
Suppose we have fit the following red-line to the following blue dataset representing the global temperature increase of Earth over 
the past centuries.
global land temperature of Earth  
Is this visually a good fit in your opinion? Why?  
I would say its not a good fit.  

What type of uncertainty dominates this dataset in the early years (before 1850)?  
Temperature began to fluctuate less.  

Is the trend seen in this dataset an example of positive correlation or negative correlation?  
Positive correlation.  

Could this dataset be classified as timeseries data? Why?  
it can cause it is in a time order.  
Download this dataset visualized above.
Then, open the file in Excel and compute the average temperature anomaly over all dates available in the file and report the single average value here.

Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  
The Bayesian school of probability theory.  
When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
Bayesian probability theory tends to be the most useful for scientific inference. This is because Bayesian methods allow for the in 
corporation of prior knowledge or beliefs into the analysis.  

Which school of thought in Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of existence of God? Why?  
Frequentist probability theory cannot define or discuss the probability of the existence of God.   
A wrong visualization.  
it starts before 0.  
Why is everything represented by integers in computers?  
In computers, everything is represented by integers primarily because of the binary nature of digital electronics.  

Name an ancestor programming language of C.  
B  

Name the first high-level programming language in computer history.
Fortran
Recall the Boolean algebra’s fundamental identities from our lecture notes. Show that,

C(A+B)⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯≡C⎯⎯⎯⎯+A⎯⎯⎯⎯ B⎯⎯⎯⎯

Show via a Venn Diagram or a Truth Table, or explain by a logical argument that (A⇒B) ≡ (B⎯⎯⎯⎯⇒A⎯⎯⎯⎯). Hint. This is a very simple question. Recall what logical implication means in terms of a Venn diagram. How does A look relative to B? Does the same also hold for B⎯⎯⎯⎯ relative to A⎯⎯⎯⎯?

Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.  
Deductive and inductive reasoning.  

What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?  
it means that they have the same truth value for all possible combinations of truth values of their component variables.  
Show, via Venn diagrams, that AB⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯≢A⎯⎯⎯⎯ B⎯⎯⎯⎯.

Can we represent all real numbers in computers?  
no  

Consider the following summation:
S=3+6+9+…+93+96+99 .
What is the value of S? Explain your novel strategy to get your answer.
(Hint: There are 33 numbers in the summation.)
