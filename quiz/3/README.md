Remember that in mathematics and Data Science, especially when proving or deriving something (like drawing Venn diagrams or Truth Tables) it is best to split the whole process (solution) to the tiniest steps possible and achieve them one after the other.
All derivation and proof questions are based on what we have covered in lecture slides and HW.


Name and describe briefly the steps involved in scientific inference.  
Observational data, Model Construction,calibration and prediction.  
Name the three pillars of science.  
Theory,Experiment and Simulation.  
Describe three different major applications of the third pillar of science with respect to the first two.
(Hint: Recall the discussions we had early in the semester during the first lecture series. 
Where and how could the third pillar replace the other pillars?)
 The third pillar explores how markets, the state, and local communities can work together to ensure inclusive economic 
development for all.
Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.
Deductive and Inductive.  
Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with an example.  
Implication is explained by laws of logic. Causation is explained by laws of nature. 
The difference is One element depends on the other so they are not the same.
Who is the Boolean algebra named after?  
George Boole  
Illustrate the logical conjunction via a Venn Diagram.

Illustrate the logical disjunction via a Venn Diagram.

What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?  
It gives the functional value true if both functional arguments have the same 
logical value, and false if they are different.  
Display the logical implication A⇒B via a Venn diagram.

(Hint. Think about the meaning of logical implication A⇒B: If A is true, then B must be true. If A is false, then B can be either true or false.
What configuration of A and B circles in a Venn diagram would correspond to the above statement for logical implication? Recall that when you are inside an object (circle) in a Venn diagram, 
it means the proposition corresponding to that object is true.
When you are outside, the proposition is false.)  

Recall the Boolean algebra’s fundamental identities from our lecture notes. Show that,  

C(A+B)≡C+AB
(C)A+B  

Show, via Venn diagrams, that AB≢A B.  

Show, via Venn diagram or truth table, that A+B≢A+ B.  

NAND equivalence.

Logic NAND and NOR.

Logical implication in terms of logic functions.

Show via a Venn Diagram or a Truth Table, or explain by a logical argument that (A⇒B) ≡ (B⎯⎯⎯⎯⇒A⎯⎯⎯⎯). Hint. This is a very simple question. Recall what logical implication means in terms of a Venn diagram. How does A look relative to B? Does the same also hold for B⎯⎯⎯⎯ relative to A⎯⎯⎯⎯?
