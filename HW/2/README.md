Consider this programming history chart, in which several programming language nodes are missing.
These languages are the following: lisp, basic, Algol 58, C, FORTRAN, Fortran 90, Python, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, sh.
Download the above PDF, add these languages to the right node in this fillable PDF file, save the file and submit it along with your answers to other questions.
Sort the above languages chronologically and write them here.
Write down the decade during which these languages were developed.


What does ENIAC stand for? Electronic Numerical Integrator and computer.  

Why is everything represented by integers in computers?  Abstraction allows us to ignore the reresentation details of an integer and simply think of it as a number.  

What is the name of the fastest part of the computer memory? cache.  

What is the slowest storage device in computers (that is typically integrated with computers)? Magnetic Tape.  

What is the smallest unit of information in computer science? Bit.  

(A) What is the closest programming language to machine code (i.e., binary code)? Assembly.  

(B) Does it need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible? Yes. 

(A) Name the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use. FORTRAN LISP and COBOL.  

(B) Approximately how many decades is it old? (±15 years is acceptable answer. the decade it was created is also an acceptable answer) +15 years.  

(A) Name a second-generation programming language. Assembly.  

(B) Which language-generation are Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, R? Third generation.  

In what decades C, C++, and MATLAB/Python were created, respectively? 1970s and 1980s.  

Name an ancestor programming language of C. BCPL.  

Name a programming language ancestor of C++. C.  

Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python.

What are the three common types of errors in computer programs? Provide an example for each category.

Suppose you write a program that has memory leak. What type of programming error you dealing with?

Consider the following chessboard.
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.
Then I ask you to put incrementally one more grain in each new square than the previous one.
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?
How many grains overall would you need to fill all chessboard squares incrementally as I asked above?
A pound of rice is roughly 7000 grains. How many pounds of rice would you need for this task.


Consider the following chessboard.
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.
Then I ask you to put incrementally one more grain in each new square than the previous one:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?
How many grains overall would you need to fill all chessboard squares incrementally as described above?

Consider the following chessboard.
Suppose I ask you to put a single rice grain in the first square.
Then I ask you to put in each subsequent square twice more than the previous square grains:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …
How many grains would you need to put in the last (64th) square?
How many grains would you need to fill the last chessboard square geometrically as described above?
A pound of rice is roughly 7000 grains. How many pounds of rice would you need for this task?
The current annual world production of rice is roughly 2×1012=2,000,000,000,000 lbs.
How many years will it take to produce the required amount of rice grains to place on this chessboard in this fashion?

What are the three fundamental components of a Turing-complete language?

Consider the following Bash script.
Identify the programmatic errors and their kinds (syntax, runtime, semantic) in this script.
Rewrite this script with the help of Linux cheatsheet in the lectures so that it does what the comments state.
# make a new directory named `subdir` in the current directory.
rm -rf ../subdir
# change the directory to `subdir` directory in the current directory.
mv ../subdir
# create a new file named `newfile.md` in `subdir` directory.
tuoch newfile.md
# show the new file contents on the command line.
tac newfile
Extra credit: How would you distinguish exponential behavior vs. power-law behavior (function) in a 2-dimensional plot?
Hint: Recall our discussion of the ENAIC project and the relative frequency of keywords such as “computer” in our programming.
